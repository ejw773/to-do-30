# To-Do-30

The "To Do App" is the classic exercise in learning web development. This challenge is to create 30 separate To Do apps, with only one day to create each one. It is not necessarily intended to be completed within a consecutive 30 days. If I do all 30 within 2 months, I'd be thrilled!

## The Rules

* Each day of participation, start the day by creating a new branch for that day. Example: to-do-01

* By the end of the day, make the final commit and deploy the app. If deployment can't be completed on that day, that's OK - but not more commits after midnight.

* Don't quit.

## That's It!

Add as many or as few features as wanted. Redux? Sure. Backend? Great. Nothing but a barely functional frontend? Some days will be like that.
