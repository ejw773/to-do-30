# To-Do 30

The "To Do App" is the classic exercise in learning web development. This challenge is to create and deploy 30 separate To Do apps, with only one day to create each one. Unlike some of the other challenges out there, it is not necessarily intended to be completed within a consecutive 30 days. If you do all 30 within 2 months, give yourself a round of applause!

## Day 15: [Super Ugly](https://todo30.com/15/)

We're going retro today with no CSS libraries. It's pretty hideous!

## Today's Reflections
- Array methods (filter, find, map) are becoming second nature
- Using hooks has become easy
- I keep coming back to [this site])(https://edvins.io/how-to-use-redux-persist-with-redux-toolkit) for help with setting up redux-persist
- After hearing about it for a long time, I finally used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) for selecting a color scheme
- For help with the header, I revisited a site I hadn't been to in a long time: [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_responsive_header)
