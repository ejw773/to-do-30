# To-Do 30

The "To Do App" is the classic exercise in learning web development. This challenge is to create and deploy 30 separate To Do apps, with only one day to create each one. Unlike some of the other challenges out there, it is not necessarily intended to be completed within a consecutive 30 days. If you do all 30 within 2 months, give yourself a round of applause!

## Day 6: [Modify Existing Tasks](https://todo.elijahwilcott.com/06)

A major flaw in previous versions was: No way to change a task that already exists. As I addressed that problem, I found myself edging toward prop drilling, so I was also going to add Redux. Unfortunately, time would not allow.
