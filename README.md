# To-Do 30

The "To Do App" is the classic exercise in learning web development. This challenge is to create and deploy 30 separate To Do apps, with only one day to create each one. Unlike some of the other challenges out there, it is not necessarily intended to be completed within a consecutive 30 days. If you do all 30 within 2 months, give yourself a round of applause!

## Still Brushing Up

Today I dug a little bit more into react-bootstrap, making the site look somewhat reasonable. I also did more with organizing state better. I looked back at what I did in early iterations, and thought to myself, "That's actually pretty good - too bad I can't remember quality stuff from the past without looking at it."
