# To-Do-30

The "To Do App" is the classic exercise in learning web development. This challenge is to create 30 separate To Do apps, with only one day to create each one. It is not necessarily intended to be completed within a consecutive 30 days. If you do all 30 within 2 months, give yourself a round of applause!

# Today's Deployed App: [Put Link to Deployed Site Here](https://elijahwilcott.com/)

## The Rules

* Each day of participation, start the day by creating a new branch for that day. Example: `todo01`

* No copy / paste.

* Don't insert code you don't understand. Research it out and add it on another day.

* By the end of the day, make the final commit and deploy the app. If deployment can't be completed on that day, that's OK - *but no more commits after midnight*.

* Put a link to your deployed site in the README for that branch (edit the "Today's Deployed App" line above). Give the link a title. Examples:
  *   "Finished before breakfast! BAM!"
  *   "Utilizes Unit Testing"
  *   "Worst one so far - next one will be better"
  *   "Learned some new styling tricks!"

* Don't quit.

## That's It!

Add as many or as few features as wanted. Redux? Sure. Backend? Great. Awesome styling? Awesome. Unit tests? Try it. Nothing but a barely functional frontend? Some days will be like that. Don't let them stop you.
