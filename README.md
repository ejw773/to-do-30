# To-Do-30

The "To Do App" is the classic exercise in learning web development. This challenge is to create and deploy 30 separate To Do apps, with only one day to create each one. Unlike some of the other challenges out there, it is not necessarily intended to be completed within a consecutive 30 days. If you do all 30 within 2 months, give yourself a round of applause!

### Landing Page

This branch is for the index landing page for my own challenge. I update it each day I deploy a new completed challenge.

To update: Simply add a new object at the end of the projectInfo array within the src/shared folder. Include a day number, a title, and a comment, and the new card will be automatically generated. Re-deploy.
