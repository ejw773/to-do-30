# To-Do 30

The "To Do App" is the classic exercise in learning web development. This challenge is to create and deploy 30 separate To Do apps, with only one day to create each one. Unlike some of the other challenges out there, it is not necessarily intended to be completed within a consecutive 30 days. If you do all 30 within 2 months, give yourself a round of applause!

## Day 14: [Redux Remixed](https://todo30.com/14/)

What a thrilling day! I stayed primarily focused on Redux, and am now getting quite comfortable with Redux Toolkit.

## Today's Wins:
- Used bootstrap-icons instead of FontAwesome
- Easily re-implemented yesterday's Redux setup (without referring to yesterday's project)
- Tinkered with react-bootstrap-drawer, but did not use it
- For the landing page, tried react-back-to-top-button, but ended up not using it
- Added accordion to landing page for bullet points
