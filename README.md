# To-Do 30

The "To Do App" is the classic exercise in learning web development. This challenge is to create and deploy 30 separate To Do apps, with only one day to create each one. Unlike some of the other challenges out there, it is not necessarily intended to be completed within a consecutive 30 days. If you do all 30 within 2 months, give yourself a round of applause!

## Today's Deployed App: [React-Bootstrap](https://todo.elijahwilcott.com/02/)

### The Rules

* Each day of participation, start the day by creating a new branch for that day. Example: `todo01`

* No copy / paste.

* Don't insert code you don't understand. Research it out and add it on another day.

* By the end of the day, make the final commit and deploy the app. If deployment can't be completed on that day, that's OK - *but no more commits after midnight*. What's done is done. And remember: The timestamp is watching you!

* Put a link to your deployed site in the README for that branch (edit the "Today's Deployed App" line above). Give the link a title. Examples:
  *   "Finished before breakfast! BAM!"
  *   "Utilizes Unit Testing"
  *   "Worst one so far - next one will be better"
  *   "Learned some new styling tricks!"

* Don't quit.

### That's It!

Add as many or as few features as wanted. Redux? Sure. Backend? Great. Awesome styling? Awesome. Unit tests? Try it. Unbelievably hideous frontend that barely does anything? Some days will be like that. Don't let them stop you.
