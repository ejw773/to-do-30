# To-Do 30

The "To Do App" is the classic exercise in learning web development. This challenge is to create and deploy 30 separate To Do apps, with only one day to create each one. Unlike some of the other challenges out there, it is not necessarily intended to be completed within a consecutive 30 days. If you do all 30 within 2 months, give yourself a round of applause!

## Day 13: [One Step Back, Two Steps Forward](https://todo30.com/13/)

I started Day 13 yesterday, and didn't finish before midnight. I took on too much with trying to learn Redux-Toolkit and Material-UI at the same time. For the first time, I had to delete an unfinished branch.

When I created a new branch this morning, I decided that today I'll just fall back onto react-bootstrap so I could focus on Redux. I still ended up spending most of my time on styling, but there was still plenty of time to flex some Redux muscles.

A Few of Today's New Things:

- Used local storage to persist Redux, using redux-persist

- Experimented with more ways to place and center a static background image (including lots of ways that didn't work!)

- Struggled with - and overcame - issues with updating an object within an array, selected by id, inside of createSlice()

- Sorted tasks based on whether or not complete
