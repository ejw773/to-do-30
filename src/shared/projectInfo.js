        title: 'React-Bootstrap',
        comment: "For today's app, I used React-Bootstrap to polish up the appearance. It looks a whole lot better than Day 1's pathetic deployed-before-breakfast app, but functionality isn't any better. I'll work on that for tomorrow's app."

        title: 'Complete / Delete Tasks',
        comment: "Today I continued with React-Bootstrap, and added the ability to check off items and even delete them. This was the first day I wasn't completely humiliated by the results. I'm actually getting somewhere!"

        title: 'Style It Up!',
        comment: 'Today I planned on just sitting on my laurels by re-creating what I did yesterday. However, once that was done, I found myself adding other styling improvements. I even integrated saving state to local storage. With hooks, itâ€™s so easy!'

        title: 'Sitting on My Laurels',
        comment: "Today I did indeed just sit on my laurels - seeking to merely repeat yesterday's success. I did make some small improvements - adding FontAwesome, for example. Eventually I need to get around to making a way to modify existing tasks."

        day: 6,
        title: 'Modify Existing Tasks',
        comment: "A major flaw in previous versions was: No way to change a task that already exists. As I addressed that problem, I found myself edging toward prop drilling, so I was also going to add Redux. Unfortunately, time would not allow."

        comment: "For the first time, I'm tackling a non-Bootstrap library. Having spent a lot of time with Bootstrap, it's actually a lot easier than I expected. Many of the same principles apply."
