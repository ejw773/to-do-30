        title: 'React-Bootstrap',
        comment: "For today's app, I used React-Bootstrap to polish up the appearance. It looks a whole lot better than Day 1's pathetic deployed-before-breakfast app, but functionality isn't any better. I'll work on that for tomorrow's app."

        day: 3,
        title: 'Complete / Delete Tasks',
        comment: "Today I continued with React-Bootstrap, and added the ability to check off items and even delete them. This was the first day I wasn't completely humiliated by the results. I'm actually getting somewhere!"

        day: 4,
        title: 'Style It Up!',
        comment: 'Today I planned on just sitting on my laurels by re-creating what I did yesterday. However, once that was done, I found myself adding other styling improvements. I even integrated saving state to local storage. With hooks, itâ€™s so easy!'

        day: 5,
        title: 'Sitting on My Laurels',
        comment: "Today I did indeed just sit on my laurels - seeking to merely repeat yesterday's success. I did make some small improvements - adding FontAwesome, for example. Eventually I need to get around to making a way to modify existing tasks."
    },
    {
        day: 6,
        title: 'Modify Existing Tasks',
        comment: "A major flaw in previous versions was: No way to change a task that already exists. As I addressed that problem, I found myself edging toward prop drilling, so I was also going to add Redux. Unfortunately, time would not allow."
    },

        day: 7,
        title: 'Material-UI',
        comment: "Today I learned the basics of Material-UI. After working so much with Bootstrap, it wasn't much of a jump. The biggest challenge, not surprisingly, was layout - Box, Conatiner, Grid. I have a lot to learn about those. I'm also not clear about how the custom styling works - but that's for another day."
    },

        day: 8,
        title: 'Material-UI: Take 2',
        comment: "Today I did a second try at Material-UI. It's even slimmer than yesterday's, but I'm tired today."
    },
    {
        day: 9,
        title: 'Material-UI is Here to Stay',
        comment: "After polling some developers, I came to the conclusion that I should switch from Bootstrap to Material-UI for the rest of the project. For today's entry, I focused on duplicating a blog post's styling of a similar app."
    },

        day: 10,
        title: 'Material-UI: Getting Comfortable',
        comment: "I'm starting to get comfortable with Material-UI - but how to organize the page is still a little mysterious to me. I'd like to add categories to the to-do list, but it may be some time before I'm able to handle all the pieces needed."

        title: 'Redux at Last!',
        comment: "Today I finally got Redux into the To-Do app. With hooks and toolkit, it's far easier than in the past. However, I did not get around to localStorage. Maybe tomorrow.",

        comment: "After weeks away, I'm back. And I forgot a lot. Sadly, today really is my first real 'copy' of the previous iteration. But I am happy to report that no copy/paste was used.",

        title: 'One Step Back, Two Steps Forward',
        comment: "Yesterday I started a project, and didn't finish before midnight. I took on too much with trying to learn Redux-Toolkit and Material-UI at the same time. So today I reverted to Bootstrap, and focused on Redux-Toolkit - especially saving to local storage.",
